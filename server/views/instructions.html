		<p>You will see a series of panoramic photos taken while moving from a <strong>goal location</strong> to other locations in a building. <strong>Your task is to write descriptions of goal object so that a smart robot can find the goal location</strong>. The robot understands language and recognizes objects about as well as a typical person. However, you should assume that the robot is visiting this building for the first time.</p>
		<p>For your reference, the goal object is indicated by <strong><span style="color:#FF0000">red</span></strong> bounding box, the path to other place is indicated by <strong><span style="color:#0000FF;">blue</span></strong> markers.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You may not see the <strong><span style="color:#0000FF;">blue</span></strong> marker sometimes - when it&#39;s under your feet.</li>
			<li><strong>These markers are not visible to the robot</strong>, and should not be mentioned in your descriptions.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Abundant descriptions will ensure that the robot arrives <strong>within 10 meters</strong> of the goal object. Therefore, we suggest:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Spelling and punctuation is important.</strong>&nbsp;Please use full sentences with punctuation (,.) and correct spelling.</li>
			<li><strong>Focus on the goal object</strong>, i.e., attributes of the goal object, relations between this object and other objects nearby, geological information</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Mouse Controls:</p>

		<ol>
			<li><strong>Left-click and drag the panoramic image</strong> to look around.</li>
			<li><strong>Right-click on a blue marker</strong> to move to that position.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Before you start, <strong>please watch examples below</a></strong>, which will help you complete these tasks efficiently.</p>
